== Description
   A Table::Body object represents a single <TBODY></TBODY> instance for an
   HTML Table.
== Notes
   In virtually every respect the Table::Body class is identical to
   the Table or Table::Row class.  Unlike Table::Foot or Table::Head, there
   can be more than one instance (i.e. it's not a singleton class).
    
   A Table::Body contains Table::Row objects.
