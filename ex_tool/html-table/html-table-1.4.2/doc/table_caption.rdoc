== Description
   A Table::Caption object represents a single <CAPTION></CAPTION> instance
   for an HTML Table.
== Notes
   The Table::Caption class is virtually identical to the Table::Row::Data
   class.  There is one important behavioral difference, however.  First,
   there can only be one Table::Caption.  If you attempt to add a second one,
   it will merely overwrite the existing one.  Second, a Table::Caption is
   always bumped to index 0.
