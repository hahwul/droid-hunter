== Description
   A Table::ColGroup object represents a single <COLGROUP></COLGROUP>
   instance for an HTML Table.

== Notes
   In virtually every respect the Table::ColGroup class is identical to the
   Table::Row class.  The only difference, beyond the begin and end tags, is
   that a ColGroup may only contain instances of the Col class.
