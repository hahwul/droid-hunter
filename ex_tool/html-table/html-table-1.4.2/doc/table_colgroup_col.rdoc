== Description
   A Table::ColGroup::Col object represents a single <COL> instance for an
   HTML Table.

== Notes
   In virtually every respect the Table::ColGroup::Col class is identical to
   the Table::Row::Data class.  The only differences are that a
   Table::ColGroup::Col instance does not contain any content, nor does it
   include an end tag.
