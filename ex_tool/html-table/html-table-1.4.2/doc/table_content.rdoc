== Description
   A Table::Content is a wrapper for content used for Table::Row::Data and
   Table::Row::Header objects.  Although it can be instantiated directly, in
   practice it is autogenerated for you.

== Notes
   Table::Content is a subclass of String and was mostly created in order
   to support a DSL style syntax as well as physical tags.

== Synopsis
   content = Table::Content.new('my content') do
      bold        true
      italics     true
      underline   true
   end
