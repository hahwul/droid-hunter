== Description
   A Table::Foot object represents a single <TFOOT></TFOOT> instance for an
   HTML Table.
== Notes
   In virtually every respect the Table::Foot class is identical to
   the Table or Table::Row class.  There is one significant difference.
   The Table::Foot class is a singleton.  There can be only one
   Table::Foot instance per table.
